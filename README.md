## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Landing Page**  
   - Displays a hero section with `OIP.jpg` background and a "See Products" button.
   - Clicking the button or anywhere on the landing section navigates to `products.html`.

2. **Product Management**  
   - Products are defined in `script.js` with attributes like name, price, and image.
   - The product list is dynamically rendered inside the `#product-list` container.

3. **Cart System**  
   - Items are stored in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence.
   - The cart page shows the total price and allows removing products.
   - A simple order form collects user details.
